# wikipedia-Based-Voice-AssistantThis project is a Wikipedia-based Voice Assistant for everyday information retrieval. The voice assistant, named MTAB (Mihretab Nigatu's Talking Friend), allows users to interact with it using speech input and provides them with information from Wikipedia.

The main functionalities of the voice assistant include:

1. Speech Recognition: The assistant utilizes the SpeechRecognition library to listen to user input through the microphone and convert it into text.

2. Wikipedia Search: The assistant uses the Wikipedia library to search for the user's query on Wikipedia. It retrieves the summary of the relevant Wikipedia page for the given query.

3. Speech Synthesis: The assistant uses the pyttsx3 library to convert the retrieved information into speech and communicate it to the user.

4. Interaction Loop: The assistant engages in a continuous conversation with the user. It listens to the user's query, searches for information on Wikipedia, speaks the summary, and then prompts the user for further assistance.

The project provides a convenient way for users to retrieve information from Wikipedia using voice commands. It can be used as a personal voice assistant for various purposes, such as quick lookups, research, or general knowledge gathering.
